<p>Directions: you should have heard two notes. (If you missed them, press the
"Play it again" button to repeat them.) Press the button that corresponds
to the difference in pitch between the notes (this is an interval). If you
get it right, two more notes will be played. Otherwise, it will repeat
the same notes and you can try again with one fewer intervals to pick from.
Or press "Skip" to give up on this one.</p>

<p>To increase the difficulty, gradually add more choices using the
checkboxes. When you can get all of them, increase the number of
notes, and it will play a random melody where you have to name the
interval between each two notes. It takes practice, but if you try it a
little each day, you should gradually get better.</p>
