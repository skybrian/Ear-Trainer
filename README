A simple ear trainer in one Java file.

It quizzes the user by playing a random musical phrase and the user has
to name the intervals between each two notes in the phrase. You can
select which intervals it will pick from and the number of notes in
the phrase.

You can run it as either a standalone Swing app or as an applet in your
browser. The Swing app tends to run better.

I recommend increasing the difficulty by gradually adding more intervals.
Going from two notes to three seems to be significantly harder, so go
back to a small number of intervals again.

It should be fairly easy to understand and modify.
